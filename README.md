Project Title: Employee Demographics and Compensation Analysis
Dataset Description: The dataset consists of employee demographic and compensation data from two regions, New Zealand and India. It provides insights into various aspects, including gender distribution, salary comparisons, performance ratings, and top employee statistics.

Purpose: The project aims to analyze the demographic composition and salary trends across two regions—New Zealand and India. The objective is to explore the relationships between gender, salary, and performance ratings, and identify any discrepancies or trends within the data that could help guide HR decisions, especially regarding fairness in compensation and workforce diversity.

Tools:

Excel: Used for data cleaning, manipulation,visualization and analysis.

Findings: The analysis will likely yield insights such as:

Gender Salary Gap: Identifying whether there is a pay disparity between male and female employees.
Performance and Salary Correlation: Examining how closely employee ratings correlate with their compensation.
Regional Comparisons: Analyzing if there are significant differences between salaries or performance ratings in New Zealand versus India.
Top Performers: Highlighting the top 10 employees based on performance ratings or other factors.
The outcome of this analysis will offer actionable recommendations for improving equity and fairness in employee compensation and performance evaluation practices across the two regions. ​​
